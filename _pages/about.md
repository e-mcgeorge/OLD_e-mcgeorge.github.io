## Overview

I commenced a Bachelor of Science in 2015 at the University of Canterbury (UC) majoring in mathematics. After completing the necessary requirements for the mathematics major, I opted to spend my final semester abroad at the University of British Columbia studying a combination of conservation, atmospheric and earth sciences. Upon completion of my Bachelor of Science, I was invited to pursue further studies with an honours program at UC, which was completed with first class distinction in 2018. As part of the honours program, I completed a research project focussing on ground elevation estimation under ice flows. Following that, I was admitted  to the Ph.D. program at UC in 2019.  My doctoral work has been an extension of my honours project and is explained below.

## Why an applied mathematics PhD?

My initial interest in pursuing further studies in applied mathematics was driven by three key aspects;
- interest in the power of computation to aid and test mathematical theory
- interest in environmental science
- interest in interdisciplinary research

While many problems in mathematics can be approached from a theoretical standpoint, there are many more which may never be answered without the power of computation. I wanted to use computational methods as a tool to explore problems which do not have solutions in theory. In particular, I am interested in the use of open-source software and packages to help explore phenomena in the physical world. This led me to the field of computational fluid dynamics, which is the umbrella under which my doctoral research fits.

In geophysical flows, often the only measurements available are macroscopic ones from the free surface, such as velocity or elevation. Therefore, to accurately model the flow, methods are needed to estimate those parameters which cannot be measured but are necessary. The blanket term for this type of parameter estimation problem is an *inverse problems*. These inverse problems, as related to geophysical flows, are the focus for my research.

Finally, I consider science communication to be a core skill that all students should be honing. Due to the applied nature of my research, I have had many opportunities to present to interdisciplinary groups. These opportunities to practice science communication have been vital me as a young scientist. Due to the complexity of present and future problems facing society, it is increasingly important to be able to work in interdisciplinary research groups and communicate our capabilities, limitations, and conclusions.

Throughout my PhD candidature, I have acquired experience in:
- Applying algorithms and models from literature
- Writing and coding optimisation algorithms for use with Python libraries (FEniCS, dolfin-adjoint)
- Cleaning, filtering transforming data with Python libraries (numpy, scipy)
- Data visualisation (matplotlib, Paraview)

## Other research interests
Aside from my current doctoral research I am interested in:
- science communication,
- diversity in STEM,
- application of my current algorithms and ideas to other fluid flows, such as lava,
- use of neural networks in parameter estimations in differential equations (this is a relatively new field of research),

Born overseas but raised in rural Canterbury, I have had the privilege to call New Zealand home for most of my life. It is, I think, to this upbringing that I owe my interest in environmental science. The onset of high school made the move to Christchurch necessary for schooling, and it was here that a few dedicated teachers sparked my enjoyment for mathematics.

My hobbies are mainly outdoors pursuits that take me to places less travelled. I enjoy the challenge they present, both mentally and physically.
